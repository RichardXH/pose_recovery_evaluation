# Object detection and pose estimation toolbox

This repository provides tools to evaluate performance of an object detection and pose estimation method. It is based on the methodology introduced in the article [1], that account for object's symmetries and can deal with scenes of many object instances, potentially occluded.

This toolbox has been primarily designed for use with the [Siléane Dataset](https://rbregier.github.io/dataset2017), but it may be used with other datasets as well, provided with adapted pose annotations.
